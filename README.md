#A summary of computer vision 2D/3D annotation tools, super 
easy to use!
#Labeling tools are the first step in processing raw data. Whether it is detection tasks, segmentation tasks, 3D perception, point clouds, etc., it is necessary to produce ground-truth values ​​to supervise network learning. Enterprise-level labeling solutions are generally completed through internal self-developed tools or professional labeling teams. For individuals or small teams, an open-source and easy-to-use labeling tool is crucial. The Heart of Autopilot summarizes the fields for everyone. Commonly used annotation tools involve 2D detection segmentation/3D detection segmentation and multi-sensor calibration synchronization.
